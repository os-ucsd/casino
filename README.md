# Open Source @ UCSD Casino :game_die: 

An open source casino/arcade built by the open source community at UC San Diego! :space_invader:

## Description

This repository will host a suite of different games created by different people in the open source community at UC San Diego! It is a part of the [Open Source Summer Program](https://os-ucsd.github.io/open-source-summer.html) - meant to help people new to open source get more comfortable with proposals, pull requests, and programming in the open source world.

## What counts as a "game"?

A "game" in our casino will be some code that's hosted in this repository that a player can run. A game could be written in any language and can be built from scratch or remixed from another open sourced game. Anyone can add their own game to the casino - see the Contributing section below!

## Contributing

### Proposing a new game

0. Make sure you're signed into Github! :octocat:
1. Click on the `Issues` tab above.
2. Click on the green `New issue` button on that page.
3. In the `Game Proposal Template` section, click on `Get started` - this will pre-poulate your issue with a template for your proposal
4. Fill out the form that comes up, and make sure to delete anything in-between the `{{}}` sections!
5. Submit your proposal, and wait for feedback!

Once we receive your proposal, we will work with you to make sure your proposal makes sense. We basically want your game to 1) be appropriate for our community (see Code of Conduct below), and 2) doable programming-wise in a small time-frame (2-3 weeks). Games in this casino aren't meant to be a giant complicated piece of software - just small, fun games to get you more comfortable with open source!

Once your proposal gets accepted, then you'll get a unique seal of approval, like so:

Then, you'll be ready to start working on your game!
